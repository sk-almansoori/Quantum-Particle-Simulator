# Quantum Particle Simulation

**Quantum Particle Simulation** is an interactive C++/Raylib project that visually demonstrates core principles of quantum mechanics using animated particles and simple games. The simulation is designed for both educational and entertainment purposes, allowing users to explore quantum concepts through dynamic visuals and mini-games.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Animated Particle Simulation**  
  Particles move, bounce, and interact in a quantum-inspired environment.

- **Quantum Principles Visualization**  
  Explore and visualize key quantum mechanics concepts:

  - **Superposition**  
    Particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously.  
    _Equation_: `Î¨ = Î£ câ‚™ |nâŸ©`

  - **Uncertainty Principle**  
    You cannot simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle.  
    _Equation_: `Î”x Â· Î”p â‰¥ Ä§ / 2`

  - **Entanglement**  
    Particles can be correlated regardless of distance.  
    _Equation_: *(No specific equation)*

  - **Wave-Particle Duality**  
    Particles exhibit both wave and particle properties.  
    _Equation_: `Î» = h / p`

  - **Chaos**  
    Particles move chaotically with random velocity and color changes.  
    _Equation_: *(No specific equation)*

- **Settings Menu**  
  Toggle fullscreen mode and adjust particle count.

- **Mini-Games**  
  - **Quantum Dodge**: Avoid falling obstacles as a particle.  
  - **Formula Quiz**: Test your knowledge of quantum formulas.
